 **How to implement the game**
  1. You will need to install 
      - [Java Development Kit 7+ (JDK)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) (6 will not work)
      - [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#)
      - [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html) you only need the SDK, not the ADT bundle, which          includes Eclipse. Install the latest stable platform via the SDK Manager. You also have to create an environment                variable called ANDROID_HOME, which points at your Android SDK installation directory!
  2. Download the project as a zip file from github
  3. Unzip the zip file
  4. Go to Android Studio and import the unzipped folder 

**Current Bugs**
  1. Food may overlap
  2. Food flashes
  3. Food may be spawned too close to Protag (the game might begin too soon)
  4. Resizing the game screen distorts the map
  5. Game occasionally lags causing protagonist to walk through boundaries
