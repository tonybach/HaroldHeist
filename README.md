# Harold Heist

###What is this?###

Produced by team Vitorebl ([Victor Bordo](https://github.com/vbordo), [Tony Bach](http://tonybach.me), [Reena Thaveethu](https://github.com/Lazareena), and [Blaise Yokoyama](https://github.com/wyokoyam)) over one semester for our Software Development class, Harold Heist is a little game that reminds students at Macalester College of their favorite college memory. Even if you are not a student at Macalester, we hope this will still bring a smile to your face :)
