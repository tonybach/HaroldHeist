# Harold_Heist

###What is this?###

Produced by team Vitorebl ([Victor Bordo](https://github.com/vbordo), [Tony Bach](https://github.com/tonybach), [Reena Thaveethu](https://github.com/Lazareena), and [Blaise Yokoyama](https://github.com/wyokoyam)) over one semester for our Software Development class, Harold Heist is a little game that reminds students at Macalester College of their favorite college memory. Even if you are not a student at Macalester, we hope this will still bring a smile to your face :)

###How to play###

You can either:

_Play the game online [**here**](http://tonybach.github.io/playHaroldHeist)_.

or

_Download the code and play the game locally_: To do this, just follow these steps:

      - [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#)
      - [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html) you only need the SDK, not the ADT bundle, which          includes Eclipse. Install the latest stable platform via the SDK Manager. You also have to create an environment                variable called ANDROID_HOME, which points at your Android SDK installation directory!
